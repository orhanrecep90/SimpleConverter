# SimpleConverter
This app created with Visual Studio 2022 and .Net Core 6.  
I used the serilog for logging request and response. Maybe a middleware could be created for this purpose.  
Exceptions are handled with ExceptionHandlerMiddleware.  
Exception and request-response logs are stored in the Logs\DayDate.exe file.  
You can download the project, set as startup project the Web.app and run.
